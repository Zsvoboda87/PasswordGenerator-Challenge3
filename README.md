# Password Generator

This is a learning project assigned to demonstrate the knowledge I've acquired on JavaScript during CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The HTML and CSS was provided and some starting Javascript.  The goal was to build logic to make a functioning Password Generator.  The requirements included having prompts for length as well as confirming which types of characters the user wanted in their password.
